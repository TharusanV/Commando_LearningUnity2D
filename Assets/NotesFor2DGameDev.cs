        1 - Sprites
    - When importing sprites, shift right click all of them if you ever want to edit the properties of all of them at the same time
    - Go to 'Filter Mode' and switch it to Point (no filter) as to stop unity from messing with the image, click apply
    - If your image is a spritesheet then switch it from 'Single' to 'Multiple' then click apply.
